I wanna do my website to work

HTTP and CSS issue. I can't get the picture of the telescope to be on the top of the mountain picture.

How do place the pictures to be in the right order. I aslo follow the moon, but I want it to have its own speed in the scroll-function. The last thing is how do I get the pictures to stay the same size regardless of the resolution?
